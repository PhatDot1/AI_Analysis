115 users technically 'stagnant/declining' in usage
How many stagnant, and how many declining?

Stagnant:
From which, we can see 13 are problematically stagnant, having never changed their usage, of these 11 are stangant at 0% usage, having not yet adopted AI into their workflow.
users 1118, and 1164 stuck at 50, and 66.7% respectively being less problematic cases.
[graph to show]

Declining:
102 users declining in their average AI usage, but most have only had 1 declining month, making it a potential anomaly, and wanting further data before deeming it a significant problem. And again, 13 of which have declined for more than just 1 month. 

I deemed this count a more important metric for noticing those who declined compared to something like the average month on month absolute percent change, because it would not be as skewing to those who adopted AI late AND MAKING SURE THOSE TO 

ADD AUXILLIARY MONTH "PRE JAN" THAT IS 0% FOR ALL TO MAKE CALCULATIONS MORE FAIRAND MENTION HOW IT WAS ADDED TO ENSURE THOSE WHO ADOPT LATE'S METRICS ARE COMPARABLE AND MAKING SURE THOSE WHO STARTED OFF AT 100% ADOPTION ARENT FLAGGED AS SIGNIFICANTLY PROBLEMATIC!

AND REMAKE ABS % TO JUST ACCOUNT FOR AND BE WEIGHTED BY THE INDIVIDUAL HOURS!!!
