## How would you design a simple data pipeline to automate this reporting on a weekly basis?

First quickly establish/ensure data is coming in with unique keys, correct timestamps, and standardized formats (e.g. ISO-8601 dates), and that any necessary indexes or partitions are configured for efficient incremental reads.

1. **Schedule & Trigger**  
   - Use a cron job (GitHub Actions `schedule:` or AWS EventBridge/Cloud Scheduler) to kick off the pipeline every week.  
   - e.g. `cron(59 0 * * 1)` for Mondays at 1 AM.

2. **Discover Schema & Columns**  
   - Query the Databases’s metadata API to fetch current column names.  
   - Hard-coded 1:1 mapping: existing columns → relevant data-keys; unmapped columns → `null` placeholders.

3. **New-Column Alert**  
   - If any column not in your mapping arrives with non-null values → trigger an external API (e.g. send email or Slack message) asking for review/action.  
   - Optionally wrap this in an agent so it flags and categorises automatically?

4. **Fetch New Records**  
   - Perform a GET request or direct DB read for rows with `status = 'pending' OR last_run_timestamp < created_at`.  
   - Pagination: page through results, updating a high-watermark column (e.g. `processed_at`) for incremental loads. [needed depending on the database used]

5. **Data Cleaning & Validation**  
   1. **Schema Contract Validation**  
      - Define expected schema via JSON Schema/Pydantic.  
      - Fail-fast or default-fill: required fields missing → abort or fill default; type mismatches → coerce or quarantine.
   2. **Type Coercion & Parsing**  
      - Explicitly apply coercion functions in the code
      - OR: call a **coercion agent** pre-equipped with all necessary data-type–transforming tools, which will automatically iterate through parser/transformer functions until each field conforms to the schema contract (or escalate if it can’t).
   3. **Null & Missing Handling**  
      - Drop if critical data returns null.  
      - Impute (or forward-fill?) non-critical fields.  
      - Quarantine rows with unexpected nulls into a separate table/bucket.
      - OR default the field to an explicit “invalid” sentinel value that downstream steps recognize and skip (while automatically flagging for later correction).
   4. **Domain & Referential Integrity**  
      - Enforce value constraints (e.g. an auxilliary single select status field ` ∈ {pending, running, complete, failed}`).  
   5. **Duplicate Detection**  
      - Check unique input keys; on duplicates pick latest or most complete record.
   6. **Anomaly Detection**  
      - Statistical bounds (μ ± 3σ), spike detection on values with internal flagging/alert.
   7. **Automated Quality Tests**  
      - Integrate Great Expectations:  
        ```yaml
        expect_column_to_exist: ['user_id']
        expect_column_values_to_be_in_set:
          status: ['pending','complete','failed']
        ```
      - Fail the run on critical expectation failures.

6. **Quarantine & Fallbacks**  
   - Route quarantined rows (schema, integrity, parse errors) to a “quarantine” table or object storage.  
   - Surface a summary to Slack/email for manual triage.  
   - Automatic retries for transient DB/API errors (exponential back-off).

7. **Transform & Enrich**  
   - Apply your existing logic to the cleaned data: compute metrics, pivot tables, aggregate stats.  
   - Write outputs to dashboards (e.g. BI tool tables), to new DB tables, or to CSV exports.
   - Optional AI Enhancement: Dynamic KPI Engines - maintain a manifest of metric specs (inputs + logic), and at runtime the pipeline executes each spec to compute its KPI.

8. **Post-Run Housekeeping**  
   - Update processed-at/high-watermark cursor in your source table.  
   - Mark original `status = 'complete'` (or insert into a history table).  
   - Emit run metrics: rows read/processed/quarantined, run time, and anomaly counts to your monitoring (CloudWatch/Grafana).

9. **Dashboarding & Reporting**  
   - Trigger dashboard refresh (if supported) or publish a new static report.
   - Optional AI Enhancement: Natural-Language Dashboard & Chat Interface - index logs and DataFrames in a vector store (LlamaIndex, Pinecone) and expose a chat endpoint for stakeholders to query insights (“Which teams dipped >10 pts last week?”).
  

**Notes**  
- Will likely uncover new edge cases when you build—iterate by adding new expectations, alerts, or fallbacks as needed.   
- For full autonomy, explore “agentifying” the new-column review and quarantine-handling steps or the edge cases above with a light LLM-driven assistant.
- Could consider wrapping this entire pipeline in a framework like Airflow for visibility/retries/templating. 


## Additional Reporting Agent?

- **Executive Summary** agent: ingest key metrics and thresholds, then output 3–5 bullet-point insights, risks, and recommendations.  
- **Investment Check**: feed metrics into a light AI model to answer “Continue investing?” or “Redirect investment?”  
- **1-Pager & PPT**: minimal step—call GPT to draft slides and use `python-pptx` (or SlidesAI) to auto-generate if desired.  


##  Suggest three KPIs that could measure long-term AI tool success over 12 months.

1. **Adoption Rate Growth**  
   - **Definition:** Month-over-month percentage increase in active users (AI tasks ÷ total tasks).  
   - **Why it matters:** Tracks sustained uptake and highlights stall points.  
   - **Outcome pairing:** Correlate with business metrics (e.g. deal velocity, time-to-hire) to confirm efficiency gains translate to real impact.

2. **Cumulative Time-Saved Growth**  
   - **Definition:** Running total of minutes saved by AI vs. manual workflows, reported monthly.  
   - **Why it matters:** Quantifies efficiency improvements over time and demonstrates ROI ramp-up.  
   - **Outcome pairing:** Tie to cost savings or headcount redeployment value to show dollar impact.

3. **Accuracy Stability Index**  
   - **Definition:** Monthly proportion of predictions above a target accuracy threshold (e.g. ≥70%).  
   - **Why it matters:** Early warning for concept or semantic drift—declines signal need for retraining or model refresh.  


## What data quality issues might you expect in real-world usage logs of an AI tool?

1. **Output Variance & Feature-Induced Drift**  
   Unlike deterministic systems, AI models produce stochastic outputs. As you add new modules or features, this inherent variance can amplify—leading to less predictable results and unstable workflows. 

2. **Duplicate & Overlapping Records**  
   When an agent makes API invocations (tool calls) and enters retry loops or iterative feedback/self-reflection cycles—combined with auto-saves or parallel calls—you can end up with duplicate events for a same action.  

3. **Session Fragmentation**  
   If there is a portion of the task that involved waiting significantly for an AI execution, users may often break a single task into multiple discontiguous sessions (e.g. switching between apps) leading to understate true session durations.

4. **Bias in Logged Interactions**  
   High-volume “power-users” dominate logs, masking occasional users and skewing averages. If these skewed logs feed into self-training loops, the model can become overly tailored to power-user behaviors, further amplifying bias.  

5. **Incomplete or Missing Entries** 
   Network failures, client crashes or abandoned sessions during AI runtime can leave partial logs with no clear “end” markers, complicating duration and success-rate calculations.

6. **Intent & Prompt Format Drift**  
   As internal or external prompting conventions evolve, new or rephrased prompts may fail to match existing NLP parsers—leading to misclassified workflows and undercounted usage.

7. **Unstructured / Free-Text Prompts**  
   If workflows start with natural language prompts, there may be a variability in how users phrase requests which could make it difficult to classify workflows or measure prompt effectiveness without robust NLP preprocessing.
