# Executive Summary

Over Q1 2025, adoption of the AI automation tool varied across teams: People leads at 55%, Finance trails at 45% (down from 57% to 41% Jan–Apr), and Sales averages 49%. Seventeen users show multiple months of declining or zero usage, indicating potential pockets of disengagement that require ongoing monitoring.

AI-assisted tasks deliver 32–41% time savings, with Sales’ hiring pipeline benefiting most (~41%) and the lowest gains (~30%) in People’s hiring pipeline and Sales’ quote builder. Prediction accuracy averages 77–80%; Finance quote builder has the highest low-accuracy (<70%) rate at 37%, and a 65% drop in May’s forecast model appears an outlier. Minor correlations between session length and accuracy suggest semantic drift is not material at current durations. Potential risks of introducing AI workflows include uneven adoption creating silos and intermittently underpowered workflows, which may increase support overhead.

## Top Recommendations

1. **Continuous Monitoring & Benchmarking**  
   – Weekly dashboards tracking adoption rates, top/bottom users, and efficiency trends.

2. **Champion & Knowledge Sharing**  
   – Identify the top AI utilizers to capture and share best practices via demos and playbooks.

3. **Developer Feedback Loop**  
   – Log semantic and concept drift at session thresholds; prioritize feature requests—state persistence, flexible prompts—in the roadmap.

4. **Governance & Scaling**  
   – Create an onboarding framework and quarterly AI Adoption Council to review metrics and refine strategy.

Institutionalizing **monitor → champion → share → feedback** should sustain efficiency gains, drive engagement, and result in continuous improvement.
