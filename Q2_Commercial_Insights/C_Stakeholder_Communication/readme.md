# AI Tool Performance Brief

## 1. How would you explain your findings to non-technical stakeholders (e.g. Head of Sales or People)? 

- **Start with Business Impact**  
  Highlight headcount and dollars by converting time saved across teams into full-time equivalent headcount. 

- **Tie Efficiency & Opportunity Cost to the Bottom Line**  
  Efficiencies are porposed to move the P&L, so if possible, use financial data to map accuracy and timesave to revenue, ensuring stakeholders see the impact of performance slips.

- **Highlight Key Risk Signals**  
  Use statistical tests to prove outliers aren’t noise (e.g. Finance Quote Builder misses 70% accuracy in 37.5% of runs; p < 0.001).

 - **Explain Hidden AI Risks with Supporting Data**  
  Emphasize that strong early results can mask silent threats such as **concept drift**, where evolving real-world data gradually erodes accuracy. Cite benchmarks and recommend automated drift alerts with quarterly retraining.

- **Next Steps & Action Items**  
  Outline a roadmap: monitor flagged users weekly, deliver targeted coaching to stagnant cohorts, and hold quarterly reviews of adoption, accuracy, and drift to update thresholds and retraining schedules.  




## 2. What metrics or visualisations would you highlight to ensure clarity and engagement?
1. **Adoption Funnel**  
   - % Tried → Regular Users → Power-Users.  
2. **Time-Saved Bar Graph**  
   - Average minutes saved per task type (Budget, Forecast, Hiring, Quotes). 
3. **Accuracy Trend Line**  
   - Monthly prediction accuracy with shaded 95% confidence bands. 
4. **Traffic-Light Scorecard**  
   - Pair Metrics with Targets and Provide Visual Representations.
